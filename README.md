# üå™Ô∏è AI-Powered Disaster Prediction System

An AI-based web application that predicts natural disasters using weather data. It uses machine learning (Random Forest) for disaster classification and integrates a blockchain layer (Ethereum) for transparency and secure logging. Built with Python, Flask, HTML, and Web3 technologies.


- Predict disaster likelihood based on rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- User authentication system for secure access
- Interactive data visualization dashboard
- Responsive and modern UI
